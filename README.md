## **ðŸ›  How It Works**

**High-level flow:**
1. **Create Challenge**  
   - Initiator sets challenge details (goal, stake amount, deadline).  
   - Contract stores challenge data on-chain.  
   - Backend integrates with **Solana Attestation Service** to set credential & schema storage.

2. **Join Challenge**  
   - Challenger deposits SPL tokens before deadline.  
   - If staking SOL, frontend auto-wraps to wSOL.

3. **Attestation & Winner Resolution**  
   - At challenge end, attestor signs attestation.  
   - Backend indexes winners, stores results in DB, uploads to Arweave.  
   - Merkle root of winner list stored on-chain for verification.
